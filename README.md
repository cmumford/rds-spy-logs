# rds-spy-logs
Collection of RDS Spy logs from various FM stations throughout the world, recorded by myself on-location or through awesome SpyServer network. Multitude of logs containing different quirks of RDS broadcasting as performed by broadcasters from different countries.  
  
Fun examples include:  
<Sweden/E203 - 2019-05-04 18-02-28.spy> - dynamic PTY  
<Sweden/E220 - 2019-05-04 02-42-16.spy> - buggy RDS coder (not present on different frequency: <Sweden/E220 - 2019-05-04 17-39-54.spy>)
<Russia/77C1 - 2019-05-04 01-32-30.spy> - random RDS groups I have never seen before in the wild  
<France/FE37 - 2018-01-02 19-20-18.spy> - TMC, unencrypted  
<USA/5CBC - 2019-05-04 00-10-45.spy> - lots of TMC messages, encrypted  
<Germany/D3A3 - 2019-05-04 20-15-21.spy> - Radiotext Plus  
and many more...
